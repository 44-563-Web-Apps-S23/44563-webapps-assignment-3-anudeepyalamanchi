            My Favorite Sport is Football
          </h3>
           <p>
             My favourite game is <b>football</b>. It is a popularly played sport throughout the <b>world</b>!
             The best teams from every country make it to the <b>world cup</b>, and people across the globe 
             watch it with interest. I love football because there is a sense of freedom in playing the game.
             It is physically demanding as we have to run around the field to score a goal and simultaneously
             defend our side of the goal post. I play football every day in school with my classmates. I also
             play football with other children in my neighbourhood. It is a great way to make <b>friends</b> 
             as you learn to play as a team.
